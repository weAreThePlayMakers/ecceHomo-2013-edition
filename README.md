Ecce Homo is a journal documenting an experiment carried out by a pair of robots: 

 - [@rafszul](https://twitter.com/rafszul)  
 - [@tala703](https://twitter.com/Tala703)   

to apply practices of social coding as they evolve in the context of open source software development to somewhat more demanding in terms of maintenance costs realities of hardware development. 

> Please note that **hardware** in the above statement has broader than usual/technical definition and is understood as all that is **not digital**. 
> The reason for this use is our belief that both **virtual** as applied to **all that is digital** and **analog** as applied to **all that is not digital** could have negative connotation and might be perceived as derogatory term which we would like to avoid (see references to **human factor** below).

This repository contains graphics documenting initial few months of the off-line phase of the experiment covering the second half of 2013. The accidental beginnings which set out the form of the journal are explained in the introduction with all the links and credits. 

The graphics are presented with [reveal.js](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js) and the result can be seen here  [ecceHomo - 2013 edition](http://noviceapp.com/eccehomo/#/) as well as in [the original album on ecceHomo Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.620317114666145.1073741828.614364481928075&type=1&l=6757f75aea) which also contains references as well as some text in captions.
